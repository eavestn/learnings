# Setting Up Kubernetes On Windows

## Motivation(s) For This Document

Engineering is increasingly so a matter of stringing together the right resources - nicely wrapping and applying glue to the orthogonal boundaries between services.
Many resources on the web are partial, lack thorough research, or - simply - are piecemeal hacks solving problems that have _better_ solutions. This entry in my _learnings_
repository coherently strings together official (and unofficial) documentation to increase your confidence that you are applying the glue in the right areas - and doing so
with a bit of finesse that will make you feel like the programmer god you love to feel like.
